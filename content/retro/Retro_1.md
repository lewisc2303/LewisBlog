# The first retrospective

#### Sprint begin : 10-09-18
#### Sprint end: 17-09-18

This week marked the implementation of sprints. Sprints are a period of time in which short objectives are set out to facilitate quick feedback loops which is core to *Agile* practices. Retrospectives are debriefs of that sprint.

Below shall be the general format of my retrospectives, but has been retrospectively applied to this retrospective so will not be filled in with detail.

#### Happiness scale: 9/10

#### Positive:

- Started learning Scala: Completed chapters 1 and 2 of 'Scala for the Impatient'
- Learnt how to unit test: Implemented Scalactic and Scalatest testing libraries in Scala practice
- Learnt git commands from terminal
- Did some pair Programming
- gained an understanding of TDD and implemented it in daily Kata

#### Negative:
- Agile practices not fully documented
- Organisation was not managed correctly (lazy use of Trello board)

#### General notes:

#### Action items:
- Tend to trello board every morning
- Start writing down sprints coherently
