# Sprint 4

This sprint was orientated around continuing with the Haskell book whilst doing some Exercism exercises, with the aim to be competent to start my own personal project in time for the Haskell Hackathon on the 16th November.
Another aim was to learn about Docker, book SoCraTes conference and sort out Bottighofen.

#### Sprint begin : 17-10-18
#### Sprint end: 06-11-18

#### Happiness scale: 8/10

#### Positive:

- Went to Innodays which was very enjoyable and I learnt a lot about writing a web service in Scala.
- Finished Chapter 11 of Haskell book.
- Learnt the basics of Docker, Cluster systems.
- Have been doing more Katas.
- Started 'The Business Stage' of my apprenticeship and joined team Take-off for a week.
- Booked SoCraTes to CodeFreeze in January!

#### Negative:

- Didn't sort trip to Bottighofen because the Agile training is going to be in German, so need to look for another reason to visit.
- Didn't finish "The Software Craftsman" book, but I am nearly at the end now.

#### General notes:

- Focussed mainly on Haskell but due to Innodays taking up most 4 days, I was not able to get as far.

#### Action items:

- To start a test based 'To-do' project in Haskell in order to come to terms with building a project, testing and applying my Haskell knowledge.
- Try and finish the Monads chapter in the Haskell book before the Hackathon.
- look into other technology (Nix or Vim)
