# Sprint 3

This sprint was orientated around going through the Haskell from first principles book (complete up to chapter 9). And also learn the basics of Bash.

#### Sprint begin : 02-10-18
#### Sprint end: 16-10-18

#### Happiness scale: 8.5/10
I am happy with Haskell and like it as a language. It has made me really understand the benefits of a strictly typed language.

#### Positive:
- Looked into SoCraTes and got the ball rolling for booking the conference.
- Gained a grater understanding of types.
- Became competent enough in Haskell to start mini projects.
- Learnt basic bash commands and learnt how to write bash scripts.
- Went to German school placement meeting so should be able to start attending German lessons twice a week.
- **Completed the Munich Half Marathon!!!** [Here are some pics](https://www.marathon-photos.com/scripts/event.py?event=Sports/GKDE/2018/Munchen%20Marathon&match=19513&name=Lewis&new_search=1)

#### Negative:
- Didn't do many Katas, there is currently no one pushing to organise and lead them in the morning.
- Didn't sort trip to Bottighofen because I'm still waiting for my social security number.
- Didn't complete chapter 9, only got to chapter 8. However the sprint wasn't necessarily to complete chapter 9 but to get to a level of competency that I can start small projects in the next sprint, which I think I have achieved.

#### General notes:
The sprint was to complete chapter 9 however I only completed chapter 8. I also learnt the basics of bash commands and learnt how to write bash scripts. I have now ditched the git desktop and only use git through git commands and also try and solely use bash to navigate my directories.

#### Action items:
- To Sort out Bottighofen documents and plan trip
- To book SoCraTes
- Continue going through the Haskell from first principles book but also do mini projects on the side with [Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks)
- To research and learn about another tool (Vim maybe)
